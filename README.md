# mygo-vscode-theme
VSCode theme based off mygo member colors and VScode default dark modern theme

Version with mujica I believe doesn't look as good because of the darker colors of the Mujica characters. 

使用的话command pallete > Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)然后把workbench.colorTheme和editor.tokenColorCustomization如是设定或者修改即可

Added c++ support for mygo.json
